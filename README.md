# pffc
Store for the Plane Fun Flying Club website

If you'd like to set up this website on Site44, here are the steps.

Create a Site44 account, and link it to your dropbox account.

On the Site44 dashboard, create a new project, and set the url to whatever you want the url to be (currently planefunflyingclub.com)

Once you have the project root folder created, open up a terminal and cd into that directory.

You can delete any files that are existing in there from Site44

Then run the command `git clone` and the repository url for this repository.

It may create a sub-directory called pffc.  If so, you may need to manually copy and paste the contents of the sub-directory into the primary site44 app folder.

Test that the website is working by going to the domain that you set up for the app.
